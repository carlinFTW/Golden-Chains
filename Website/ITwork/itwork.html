	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >1. What kind of work is done by the IT professional?  </h2>
	<p align="center" >Gary Lin works at the Academy of Mary Immaculate and his role at the school is the Systems Administrator. He works on the school systems, such as networks, software, hardware, audio and visual. Throughout the school day, he supports staff and students with their technological needs. His work is very versatile as he is often called upon to fix anything related to technology.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >2. What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?  </h2>
	<p align="center" >During work, he interacts with his small team,  teachers, staff and students. In his team, there are two other IT professionals, one is the network administrator, and the other one is an IT helpdesk support person. He also regularly deals with Tech suppliers and other companies that deal with insurance and warranties for the hardware they deal with. Once a week, there is an IT meeting held with all of the other IT professionals in the Catholic network.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >3. Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?  </h2>
	<p align="center" >During the day he is often located at his desk making sure everything is up to date. This includes general software updates and paperwork as he mentions that since IT is an ever-changing industry, new updates are released regularly and thus have to be tested and made sure these updates are distributed to the users that need them.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >4. What aspect of their position is most challenging?  </h2>
	<p align="center" >Gary mentions that thse most challenging aspect to his work is working with a very small budget while still trying to maintain all services at a high level. Another challenging aspect to his work is that he finds that the staff and students are not willing to learn the technology and they often expect the IT group to fix their problems. He finds this difficult as he believes that once people start being more self-sufficient, then it saves the staff's and student's time.</p>

	<h1 align="center" >Transcript of Interview</h1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h2>
	<p align="center" > I currently work for Academy of Mary Immaculate and my role is Systems Administrator. I manage the school systems, including networks, software and hardware and also audio and visual. I support the staff and students in their daily technological needs.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h2>
	<p align="center" >The industry I work in is secondary education.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h2>
	<p align="center" >  Because we have a small team and we have a lot of users, we are kind of like a jack of all trades, I have been asked to fix anything that is electronic, to chairs and tables as they are “computer” related.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about
	them.</h2>
	<p align="center" >I interact mainly with teachers and students. They vary in age from 12 all the way up to 70+. In general people are pretty good with basic IT. You need to tailor the technology to the age group and also talk with them in a different manner to get your point across.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h2>
	<p align="center" >There are 3 people in IT at our workplace, one network administrator, and one IT helpdesk support person. In my job I also regularly deal with Tech Suppliers and also companies to deal with insurance and warranty cases for laptops/ hardware. We also hold network IT meetings once a term with all of the other IT people in the Catholic network.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h2>
	<p align="center" >We don't have clients and investors, however I guess out clients would be the teachers and students, we interact with them via a helpdesk system, they log a ticket and we help them. They also come in to the IT office to get help throughout the day.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >7. What aspects of your work do you spend the most time on? Please tell us about these.</h2>
	<p align="center" >Keeping everything up to date, especially paperwork. As IT is an ever changing industry, new updates are released all the time, we need to test these and then make sure that they are distributed to the users that need them. We then need to update our paperwork in regards to the changes as sometimes programs completely change between updates.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h2>
	<p align="center" >Most challenging will be dealing with a very small budget for IT and still trying to maintain all services at a high level. The other thing that is challenging is that some staff/students are not willing to learn the technology, even for very simple things and want you to just do it for them, in our role we need to teach them to be more self sufficient in terms of IT, however with some people it is impossible.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h2>
	<p align="center" >Can you please turn it off and then on again (restart) your device, this will fix 99% of all problems, we have people at work that never shut down their laptops ever.</p>
