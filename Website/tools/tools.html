	<div class = "margin">	
	<p align ="center">The work I personally finished includes IT Work, IT Technologies, building our website,  my 200-word reflection and half of the IT Technologies section. This includes the research involved, writing and coding the work, and choosing the appropriate images to help the reader further understand the text through illustrations. For my section on IT technologies, I chose to write about augmented reality and cloud computing as they were the two area’s I was most familiar with out of all the other options. The audit trail on our group’s repository accurately reflects each team member's work as we all divided it up both evenly and fairly to. Dawn completed her sections including Industry Data, team profile and her own 200-word reflection. Alfred completed the other half of IT technologies, where he wrote two essays on Raspberry Pi and Internet of things. He also finished the 400-word group reflection in which we all contributed ideas towards as it's a reflection of us as a whole. Lastly, he wrote up his paragraph for his section of the team profile which included a summary of who he is and why he's interested in learning IT.</p>
