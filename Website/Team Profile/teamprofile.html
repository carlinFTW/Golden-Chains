	<h2 align="center">Carlin McNamara</h2>
	<p align="center">Student number: s3784664</p>
	<p align="center">My name is Carlin McNamara and I am currently studying the course called Bachelor of Technology. The student number I have been given by my university is 3784664, accompanied by my given email address s3784663@student.rmit.edu.au. Prior to RMIT, I graduated from Xavier College in 2018, where I completed my VCE studies after 15 years at the school. I was taught Italian and Latin, however I did not pursue my studies in those areas as the only languages I wanted to learn were programming languages. My interest in technology was sparked from a very early age as one of my family members bought a powerful computer that I instantly became addicted to. One of my favourite past times is playing games online with my friends via steam. This hobby has now extended to me playing more modern games on my own system I built.</p>

	<h2 align="center">Dawn Aquino</h2>
	<p align="center">Student number: s3841094</p>
	<p align="center">I am a first-year undergraduate in the bachelor's degree of Information Technology, my experience in IT is very limited as I've only explored the field in the form of IT classes and the occasional IT club during the senior years of high school. The classes and activities I took part in, forged my interest in programming and coding. This is due to the debugging aspect of coding, I found it fun to debug code whenever I reached an obstacle when coding. When I am not spending my time on my studies, I enjoy playing games, reading manga and go out to do photography.</p>

	<h2 align="center">Alfred Huthomo</h2>
	<p align="center">Student number: s3790172</p>
	<p align="center">Hi! My name is Alfred. I was born in Jakarta on the 3rd of July 1999. My nationality is Indonesia, which is my native language as well. However, I enjoy speaking in English, since I came to Melbourne as an International student. Currently, I am doing my first year of Bachelor degree in Information Technology at RMIT University and completed my Diploma of Engineering last year at Monash University. What makes me choose this major is related to my hobby, which is playing computer games that are competitive multiplayer games for example Dota2 and Rainbow six siege. One interesting fact about me is, I also enjoy cooking Western and Japanese cuisine, especially in my leisure time. I was inspired by an animation movie, called Ratatouille. This movie tells how a provincial rat has a wonderful sense of smell, discovers real food and the cooking of a five-star chef.</p>

	<h2 align="center">Team Profile</h2>
	<p align="center">Since all the members have variable personalities, it is only fair that their results on three personality tests also vary. Therefore, the results below reflect this: </p>
	<br>
	<p align="center">Alfred Hutomo: </p>
	<p align="center">Myer-Briggs Test: ENTP-T, Debater </p>
	<p align="center">Learning Style Test: 45% Auditory, 30% Visual, 25%Tactile</p>
	<p align="center">The Big Personality Text: 79%O, 42%C, 73%E, 52%A, 42%N</p>
	<p align="center">Carlin McNamara:</p>
	<p align="center">Myer-Briggs Test: ENTJ-T, Commander </p>
	<p align="center">Learning Style Test: 30% Auditory, 65% Visual, 5% Tactile</p>
	<p align="center">Dawn Aquino:</p>
	<p align="center">Myer-Briggs Test: ISTJ-A, Logistician </p>
	<p align="center">Learning Style Assessment : Visual</p>
	<p align="center">The Big Personality Text: 44%O, 73%C, 4%E, 65%A, 23%N</p>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center">Conclusion</h2>
	<p align="center">Upon reading these results, these results can help allocate the leadership role, for Carlin’s Myer-Briggs personality test result. He seems to be best allocated to be the leader as according to an article by Kendra Cherry on the Commander personality type. It suggests that strength of such personality is “Strong leadership skills”, “Well-organized” and “Strong communication skills”, such traits are seen as positive for those in the roles of leadership. These results can also help allocate tasks based on the nature of them, according to a similar article about the Debater personality type Kendra Cherry. It is said that one of the strengths of this type is the extent that knowledge is valued, so it can only be more beneficial to give part of the research tasks to Alfred as he may be able to learn about different technologies and be able to connect ideas with other previously ideas. </p>

	<h2 align="center">Comparison of Ideal jobs</h2>
	<p align="center">When comparing the ideal jobs, the common elements are that they all require communicational skills and benefit from IT experience and knowledge. These ideal jobs vary in their respective industries, one is in law enforcement, one is in the gaming industry, and another one is in the IT industry. The ideal jobs do not only vary in industries but those that worked in developing projects varied in levels of work. Whilst one worked throughout the designing, creating and the implantation process, another solely worked on the code of a program. The application of I.T skilled distinguished all the ideal jobs from one another, Cybercrime detective applied IT experience and knowledge in a way that it was used to help work towards the solving of crimes, while others work towards creating projects based on user requirements at different stages of production. <br> <br>In response to the jobs,   plans were created, and these plans varied from one another. For example, throughout the group, some chose to focus on getting work in their respective industries to gain experience after graduating, others chose to focus to build on their character or enforce positive habits to match the necessary skills for their ideal job. These plans also differentiated from each other, as they focused on different aspects of university. One focused on the general experiences, the life experiences gained from the years in tertiary education. Whilst others focused on the academic part of the university. They focused on the gathering of the needed knowledge. </p>
