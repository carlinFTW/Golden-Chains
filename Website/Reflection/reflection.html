	<h2 align="center" >Group reflection</h2>
	<p align="center" >The "Gold Chains" group worked well and have a equal distributed work for each group members. We all managed to complete each of our own tasks by individually and collaborating with others to share knowledge. Carlin did a very good job in leading the team with great communication. We used all types of communication tools so that we all can get in touch fast and direct. At first this we did our meeting during tutorial session and divided the workload. All of us had a pretty fair amount of workload even Carlin the team leader which has the most responsibility in with the team success. First meeting we did was only discussing the approach we will take for the researching. And then, on the second meeting, each of us shared the progress of our work and discussed the further task. Lastly, our third meeting we also gave our progress, did some revisions, and finalized everything.</p>
	<br>
	<p align="center" >Each of us performed well, the tasks which already divided at the beginning of our meeting is done correspondently. All of us have contributed to this work by giving ideas, attending group meeting, and doing each task. We can easily overcome every problem which sometimes occurs during the work since we always ask for solution and opinion from the other colleagues and everyone in the group also gave responses. Even though, we work our task individually, but all the plan and task managing are resulted from the team ideas. </p>
	<br>
	<p align="center" >Since there is an unpredictable change to our roster, we had our one of group member diverted last minute which cause some problems like parts that he had to do, and we took action by dividing task to all remaining group member. Fortunately, we faced this problem wisely and our group still performed well. We know that this problem can happen when we are working in a team, so can accept and manage it. </p>
	<br>
	<p align="center" >Moreover, sometimes we also have lack of communication due to our busy school and work schedule, but we keep contact and share our work progress. However, our communication improved on the crucial time of the work such as when we finalized and compiled all the works into the website. Each of us did their part on time, so, we also successfully finished our website. </p>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >Carlin's Reflection</h2>
	<p align="center" >Our Intro to I.T group "Golden chains" was able to successfully work together in order to finish this assignment. The work was divided equally to each team member and everyone was able to accomplish their tasks without any major problems. The quality of the work remained high as we had a good amount of time to complete it and we were always communicating with each other. One key area that has room for improvement was the speed in which we completed our tasks. This would benefit the group website as the earlier everything is completed, the more time we have to develop the website itself to be properly formatted to suite everyone's work. The most surprising aspect to this assignment was how well we were able to do it with the current restrictions in today's society. Even though we were unable to discuss or work face-to-face, we still managed to do it with the help of conference calling apps such as 'Microsoft Teams,' and services such as GitHub. One challenge brought up to us was the absence of one of our team members as he has decided to defer this course to next semester due to these restrictions. The solution was easy as we all divided his work evenly to the rest of the group. This was done so that there wouldn't be any one person struggling with more work than the rest. One lesson learnt about working with groups is that it teaches you about individuality and shows you how everyone is able to do their work in their own unique ways. This includes their efficiency, tools and attitude towards the assignment and allows us to evaluate which personalities works well together and which ones do not. Our GitHub logs accurately reflects each team members work as we all divided our work as evenly as possible.</p>

	<h2 align="center" >Dawn's Reflection</h2>
	<p align="center" >From this assignment, starting from week five, it's been weeks of working with the group and it's members. In general, the group works and communicates well with one other, the work is taken up and given responsibly. Individually, Carlin leads the group and it's work, in a loose but effective manner. His contributions to the project outside of his leadership, is plentiful as he picks up the stray tasks that aren't picked up by others to complete.  Alfred, works well, goes out beyond his current tasks. This is as he picks up other tasks that need to be completed. </p>
	<br>
	<h2 align="center" >Alfred's Reflection</h2>
	<p align="center" >In this group assignment, I enjoyed a lot working together with Carlin and Dawn. We worked pretty well together and by Carlin's leadership there is certainly a good task accomplished from each of us. I found that this assignment improves my research skill and knowledge surrounding the IT areas. At first, I struggled a bit in explaining in detail but the more I wrote there, the better. This assignment was not as hard as I thought it was going to be but there are challenges because one of my teammates diverted and left a couple of empty topics that each of us need to replace. Overall it is a pretty enjoyable assignment and group work.</p>
